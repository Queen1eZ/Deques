# Deques

## Overview
Deque is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. They are special queues (or, equally valid, special stacks) that you can add and remove from either its front or its back.

In this project, I will compare two implementations of a deque. By the end, I will be able to:

Understand the difference between an ADT and a data structure.
Understand data structure invariants and their value in testing programs.
Practice debugging code using tests.
